#Documentation Directory
This diretory should contain the documentation you create during the evolution of this project.  Professional programmers do not 
code by stream of consciousness.  They have a plan - a design.  Documenting your design allows you to create larger develop teams, 
creates a road map for others to follow.  And is a good bread crumb trail for your future self.
